Project Rena is an online 2D drawing tool with dimensions and constraints capability. Please see a live demo here:
[http://rena-kdict.rhcloud.com/](http://rena-kdict.rhcloud.com/)

Currently it supports drawing line, rectangle, circle/eclipse and adding distance-point-line constraint. And it's easy to extend to other geometry and constraint types.

The project includes a Newton equation solver, which is based on [numeric] (https://github.com/sloisel/numeric).
